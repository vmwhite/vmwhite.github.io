                <p>The other day I found myself championing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). VBA is such an amazing tool to learn because as long as a computer has Microsoft Word or Excel installed on it, you can use it. Any business can benefit from incorporating some VBA macros and I have utilized it in <em>almost</em> all of my past internships (the only one that didn’t utilize it was because it was using python and other languages to manage their data files.) I hope you find this post inspiring to find a use of VBA in your day-to-day work as the applications of VBA are endless! Also feel free to reach out if you’re having VBA issues you’d like some help with.</p>

<p>How have I used VBA in the past? In my first internship at Lennox International, I created a macro to help me enter mind-numbing weekly safety reports into a spreadsheet faster. When I worked at Shure Incorporated, the team avidly use VBA to do a variety of things: parse through data files exported from various devices, create weekly reports and graphs, rerun data analyses etc. During my undergraduate research experience I created a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ifhnetwork/home/dowloads">VBA macro that generated labels</a> for farmers to print out on a QL-700 Brother label printer. In another case, I wrote some <a href="/docs/VBAresources/GPSwaypointsVBAtool.zip">VBA code for a friend</a> that helped them reformat the data that came from their GPS tool that reformatted the data in a way that ArcGIS could input the data. It took me a couple hours and saved my friend tens of hours of repetitive copying and pasting data into the format they needed. Additionally, when in need of some help with project planning for Randomized Control Trial that recruited multiple organizations, I created some <a href="/docs/VBAresources/PERT.xlsm">VBA code that made a PERT flowchart</a> based on steps in a project implementation to help identify bottlenecks. None of these implementations are perfect, but they show case some different uses of VBA then you might be used to.</p>

                <!-- <p>Many may not know this, but I have spent much of my life in choral groups, where I have sang more than my fair share of holiday carols. For the first time this week I saw 1974’s Mame, which is a musical movie adaption of the movie Auntie Mame. About halfway through the film the familiar tune of “We Need a Little Christmas” started playing. In this scene, the characters decide to celebrate Christmas early, in fact, two weeks before thanksgiving early. It serves as a happy distraction of the Great Depression that has left Auntie Mame’s large house stripped of all but a few furnishings. They characters revel in joy and good cheer as they decorate one of the characters in tinsel and lights in lieu of a tree.</p>

                <p>Many may not know this, but I have spent much of my life in choral groups, where I have sang more than my fair share of holiday carols.

About halfway through the film the familiar tune of “We Need a Little Christmas” started playing.

It serves as a happy distraction of the Great Depression that has left Auntie Mame’s large house stripped of all but a few furnishings. They characters revel in joy and good cheer as they decorate one of the characters in tinsel and lights in lieu of a tree.</p>

<p>Watching this scene play out, I couldn’t think of something more perfect for what all of us could use today. In Reply-All’s podcast episode <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/kwh96n">#168 “happiness Calculator vs. Alex Goldman</a>, they discuss the <a href="https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/">hedonometer</a>, which measures the average “happiness” of English-speaking twitter users. At one point Alex asks, what do the researchers use as a unit of happiness, or how do they communicate how “happy” is one day from another. Funny enough, the researchers say their preferred unit is a “Christmas Day”, as this is the largest, most consistent spike they have seen over time. The show then goes on to discuss how this year has been one of the “least happy” years since they started using the hedonometer in 2008.</p>

<p>Today, we are just about two weeks away from Thanksgiving, in the middle of a pandemic, where much seems uncertain heading into what is sure to be a bleak winter, we are in need of some Christmas level cheer.</p>
