You know, it’s pretty incredible how I ended up in the field of Operations Research. A field that is able to connect my diverse interests and skills. The truth is, I had no idea this field even existed until my junior year of college. I didn’t wake up one day with a burning desire to become an Operations Researcher. No, it was a gradual and meandering journey filled with uncertainty and contemplation about my future. So, how did I find my way here?

I had a knack for math and science in middle and high school. Pursuing medicine seemed the obvious choice back then, but the sight of needles made me squeamish, so medicine was out. Instead, I thought maybe being an engineer would be a good fit, though I didn’t know which type. Then, by pure chance,  I got a college pamphlet in the mail that talked about Industrial Engineering. It described the art of enhancing processes using mathematics, and I was captivated by the idea of utilizing math to address the chaotic and inefficient aspects of my own life. (if you don’t believe that math can be an art [give this blog a read](https://punkrockor.com/2021/06/24/on-the-art-of-modeling/))

When I began my Industrial Engineering major, my IE 101 professor said, *“Industrial engineers improve processes to help people.”* Those words gave me hope I had chosen the right major and have stuck with me ever since. Additionally, my favorite classes were decision analysis and Introduction to Operations Research. I was blown away by the ability to break down complex decision problems into mathematical models, ultimately leading to optimal or “best” solutions. That class, paired with spontaneously starting undergraduate research my senior year of college, is what led me to apply for a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Operations Research.

Today, I love that my work spans various societal issues and collaborates with a diverse range of stakeholders and decision-makers. Admittedly, it can be frustrating at times when I’m not the ultimate decision-maker. However, I cherish the opportunity to collaborate with those who are willing to listen and strive for improvement. The policy changes and insights resulting from my analyses and models have the potential to positively impact entire groups of individuals within the systems I study.

Looking back, there are a few things that would’ve helped me discover what I love sooner:

- Seeing a simple optimization model be solved
- Seeing someone breakdown a complex everyday problem into a decision tree analysis
- Doing undergraduate research earlier, such as sophomore or junior year
- Understanding what operations research is and what it isn’t
- Knowing that operations research is multidisciplinary and that there are a variety of undergraduate majors that could lead to a career in it, see the table below.
- The fact that many STEM PhDs are fully funded. That is, my tuition is paid for, and I make a small salary that’s slightly above minimum wage. Also, you can do summer internships that often pay more than you’ll make in a whole year. 

Ultimately, my journey has taught me the power of Operations Research. It’s not merely a collection of skills and methodologies but a means to make a tangible difference in people’s lives. By embracing this field, I have found my purpose: to use mathematics and analysis to create a brighter future for individuals and society as a whole.
