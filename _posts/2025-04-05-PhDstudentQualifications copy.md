 reflect on his motivations for receiving a PhD and if it truly aligns with his life goals and purpose.
If he aims to make a positive contribution to society through modeling healthcare, he may be qulaified already to:
Be a systems engineer or solutions engineering in healthcare, such as "GE Healthcare's systems engineering" and "Epic Software's Technical Solutions Team"
Try consulting. This could be working for a larger hospital group or insurer such as Mayo Clinic's "Management Engineering and Consulting (ME&C) team", or working for a consulting firm that works with hospital's among other businesses such as "IBM" among many others.
If he aims to truly be a researcher, then find some sort of research experience that is related to the work he wishes to study. From best to worst from talking with him this would be:
Working at a company that does research and helping out with research projects, ideally getting on some academic papers.
This could be volunteering for unpaid research projects while working a job.
Obtaining master's degree with a master's research thesis. This likely would cost $$ to Mr. Mwiti unless he is lucky enough to find a paid master's thesis opportunity, possible, but hard to find. You could reach out to specific faculty you are interested in working under and seeing if they have opportunities to get paid, it may look like doing option 2 with a faculty, until they have funding to pay you to do (3).
