Machine learning is everywhere. As algorithms advance neural netowrks have become more popular. So what is a neural network anyway? Here we will break down what machine learning is and how neural netowrks fit into machine learning.
A basic defintions is that machine learning is the creation of a formula, alorithm, or other mathematical representation using some data that is then used to explain or summarize something about the realtionships between teh variobles in the provided dataset.
This process of generating a machine learning model involves the following processes that genreally occur in the following order:
1. Cleaning your dataset
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training/Classification
4. Final Model
A neural network does the feature extraction for you by combining your various variables into new ones. The cons is that this feature engineering is not tractible meaning it is unclear what the final mix of varibles is.
