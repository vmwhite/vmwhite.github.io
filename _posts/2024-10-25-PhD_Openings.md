I am looking for a Ph.D. student to start Fall 2025. Possible topics include a focus on causal inference modeling, queueing networks, discrete event simulation, and optimization. I've included some relevant past work below. These methodologies will be applied to crisis response planning, school safety and mental health, and the US court system. Potential students should have interests and/or relevant training in one or more of the above topic areas and subject areas. Interested students can email me with the subject “FAMU-FSU Potential Ph.D. student for Fall 2025” at vwhite@eng.famu.fsu.edu with their CV, unofficial/official transcripts, and two to three paragraphs of how their interests and training align with the work that I do. If I feel that this might be a good fit, I will set a meeting with you for us both to ask questions. Thank you for considering being a part of my lab, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Brief Mentoring Philosophy: 
It is my goal as a faculty member to be a mentor to students from a variety of backgrounds and programs. I promise to provide a safe environment built on mutual respect and understanding, hold you accountable to the goals you set, and provide guidance on what research and meaningful research deliverables are. I aim to build relationships with my students that make them feel supported and valued. I expect you to do your best and communicate quickly when personal and research-related issues arise, especially when they impact your work and progress. I look forward to working with you, learning about what motivates you, and working together to achieve our goals.
