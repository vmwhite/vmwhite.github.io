 An overarching theme of my Ph.D. has been a constant battle of Imposter Syndome, and feeling like I didn't really "fit" anywhere  when it came to researchdirections. A lot of the oppoturnies I sought out was in trrying to find that "fit". Spoiler alert fitting in never worked and instead recognizing that I could cerate my own style of working, research questions, and work that interested me that was unique to me. My own unique "fit" to the intersections of academia, operations research, and society. 

My first year of my Ph.D. was **ROUGH**.
