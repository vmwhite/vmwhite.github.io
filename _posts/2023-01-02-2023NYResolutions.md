As a new and exciting year lies ahead, I am finding myself happy, nervous, excited, and a little sad. I know this year will bring new challenges and decisions in closing the current chapter of my life as a Ph.D. student and embarking on my new one in starting my first full-time position. This past year I accomplished a lot, both interpersonally and externally. This next year I hope to build on my progress and strive for the following resolutions:
- Scheduling daily time to work out and write
- Recognizing when I need help and asking for it 
- Meal prepping at least once per week
- Reading for pleasure instead of watching TV to relax
- Being kinder to myself for my shortcomings and mistakes

I plan to revisit these resolutions throughout the year to help me in reaching my yearly goals:
- Complete my Ph.D.
- Start a new Job
- Submit my remaining Ph.D.-related papers for publication (and hopefully get them published)
- Take an international vacation
- Take a domestic vacation
- After I move, find ways to connect to my new community (e.g., partake in a local 5k, join a choir)



In closing, I'm happy for all I have accomplished, a little sad to know I will not end this year in Madison, WI, and nervous and excited for what this new year will bring! I hope this brings you inspiration to write out your resolutions and goals and share them too.
