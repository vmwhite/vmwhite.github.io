georgia state literature review on Virtual best practices for virtual learning: https://gpl.gsu.edu/publications/virtual-instruction-k-12/. noted that logistical issues like accessing materials were often among the most significant obstacles to online learning

That basic insight echoed a 2019 study that highlighted the crucial need to organize virtual classrooms even more intentionally than physical ones. Remote teachers should use a single, dedicated hub for important documents like assignments; simplify communications and reminders by using one channel like email or text; and reduce visual clutter like hard-to-read fonts and unnecessary decorations throughout their virtual spaces.

how to grade:
By leaving video feedback https://teacher-totter.blogspot.com/2018/10/four-ideas-to-improve-feedback-for.html , using text expanders https://teacher-totter.blogspot.com/2014/03/using-technology-to-create-learning.html , leveraging one-on-one conferences, and making use of feedback portfolios, I was able to provide feedback that was more than just the sum of the mistakes.

" I stopped giving them their grades with their feedback. Guess what? They stopped paying attention to their grades. This one's easy, but it works wonders." (idea: give them feedback and then have them do somthing with that feedback. )
