<h1>bio</h1>
<p> I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My dissertation research involves using data analyses and mathematical models to aid decision making at the intersection of the opioid crisis and policing. From October 2018 to May 2020, I worked as a research assistant for the Center for Health Enhancements and Systems Studies (CHESS). I helped implement a Substance Use Disorder mobile app in mental health clinics across Iowa with CHESS. In October 2020, I started a Research Assistantship with the National Institute of Justice to learn more about criminal justice issues and explore future research directions. As part of my dissertation, I have worked closely with the Madison Police Department (MPD) and the UW Family Medicine and Community Health Department to evaluate a local arrest diversion program. I have also studied alternative police response models and have introduced a discrete event simulation to evaluate policy changes regarding arrest diversion programs. I expect to graduate from my Ph.D. program in May 2023.

<!-- In the past, I have worked closely with the Madison Police Department (MPD) and their collaborators to evaluate the Madison Addiction Recovery Initiative (MARI), which is an arrest diversion program. We used causal inference methods that found the non-randomized MARI program showed causal reductions in 6-month recidivism among program completers and those that are likely to complete the program. This work informed MAARI, the next version of the program, and received local press coverage (radio interview, news article). This lead to some of my other current work, where I am introducing a discrete event simulation to evaluate community-level effects of policy changes that leverage addiction treatment (such as an arrest diversion program).  -->
