<h1>bio</h1>
<p> I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my BS in Industrial Engineering from Iowa State University and MS from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
    I am an operations researcher. 
    My research involves using mathematical models to understand the opioid crisis in the Dane County, WI area. 
    I have worked closely with the Madison Police Department (MPD) and the UW Family Medicine and Community Health department to tackle this problem. 
    From October 2018 to May 2020, I worked as a research assistant for the Center for Health Enhancements and Systems Studies (CHESS). 
    With CHESS, I helped implement a Substance Use Disorder mobile app in mental health clinics. In October 2020, I started a Research Assistantship with the National Institute of Justice to learn more about criminal justice issues and explore future research directions. 
    I expect to graduate from my Ph.D. program in May 2023.
