<h1>bio</h1>
<p> I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my BS in Industrial Engineering from Iowa State University and MS from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am an operations researcher. My research involves using mathematical models to understand the opioid crisis in communities. From October 2018 to May 2020, I worked as a research assistant for the Center for Health Enhancements and Systems Studies (CHESS). I helped implement a Substance Use Disorder mobile app in mental health clinics across Iowa with CHESS. In October 2020, I started a Research Assistantship with the National Institute of Justice to learn more about criminal justice issues and explore future research directions. As part of my dissertation, I have worked closely with the Madison Police Department (MPD) and the UW Family Medicine and Community Health Department to evaluate a local arrest diversion program. I have also studied alternative police response models and have introduced a discrete event simulation to evaluate policy changes regarding arrest diversion programs. I expect to graduate from my Ph.D. program in May 2023.
