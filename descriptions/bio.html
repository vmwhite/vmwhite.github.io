<h1>bio</h1>
<p> Veronica White is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She has worked as a research assistant for the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the University of Wisconsin Madison's Center for Health Enhancements and Systems Studies (CHESS). Her research interests involve using operations research, analytics, and decision science to application areas at the intersection of public health and safety (e.g., substance use, mental health, public policy, policing, healthcare access, criminal justice, and homelessness). Veronica's work has led to more than ten academic journal articles and proceedings, several government reports, and local media attention. She has worked with various collaborators: professionals in substance use disorder, medical doctors, police, parole officers, judges, farmers, and social science researchers. In 2022, Veronica was selected as a finalist for the DAS/SDP Decision Analysis Practice Award. Additionally, She helped lead the INFORMS DEI Ambassador project that laid the groundwork for a future high school outreach program for operations research and management science.

<!-- <p> I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My dissertation research involves using data analyses and mathematical models to aid decision making at the intersection of the opioid crisis and policing. From October 2018 to May 2020, I worked as a research assistant for the Center for Health Enhancements and Systems Studies (CHESS). I helped implement a Substance Use Disorder mobile app in mental health clinics across Iowa with CHESS. In October 2020, I started a Research Assistantship with the National Institute of Justice to learn more about criminal justice issues and explore future research directions. As part of my dissertation, I have worked closely with the Madison Police Department (MPD) and the UW Family Medicine and Community Health Department to evaluate a local arrest diversion program. I have also studied alternative police response models and have introduced a discrete event simulation to evaluate policy changes regarding arrest diversion programs. I expect to graduate from my Ph.D. program in May 2023.
